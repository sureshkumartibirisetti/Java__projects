# 🎯 Java Mini Projects

Welcome to my **Java Mini Projects** repository! 🎉 This repository is a collection of simple command-line based Java applications, starting with my first project: **Day Checker**. More projects will be added as I continue to explore and develop Java programs. Stay tuned for updates! 🚀

## 📜 Project 1: Day Checker 🗓️

The **Day Checker** is a basic Java program where the user inputs their date of birth (day, month, and year), and the program calculates the day of the week they were born on. If incorrect inputs are provided, the program will notify the user of the error. Here’s what it does:

### ✨ Features:

- 🗓️ **Input**: Enter your **date of birth** (day, month, year).
- 🤖 **Output**: The program will calculate and display the **day of the week** you were born on.
- 🚫 **Error Handling**: If the input is incorrect, it will display a message to ensure you enter valid data.

```plaintext
Hey Welcome to Day Finder Calculator!
Enter The Date (1-31): 7
Enter The Month (ex: January): march
Enter The Year (ex: 1999): 2003
Please confirm Your Date of Birth: (7/march/2003)

You're born on Friday
Thank you! Visit again

If the answer is wrong, you are definitely giving wrong inputs.
```

### 🛠️ How it works:

1. The program takes **three inputs**: Day, Month, and Year.
2. It uses Java logic to calculate the **day of the week** based on the input provided.
3. If the input doesn't match a valid date, an error message will appear guiding the user to correct their input.

## 🎯 Future Projects:

This repository will soon include more Java mini projects, such as:

- 📅 **Date Difference Calculator**: Find the difference between two dates.
- 🧮 **Simple Calculator**: A basic calculator performing arithmetic operations.
- 🔢 **Number Guessing Game**: A fun number guessing game!
- 🕹️ **Rock, Paper, Scissors Game**: A simple command-line game.
- 🔐 **Password Validator**: Check the strength of a password based on input.

Stay tuned for more exciting mini Java projects! 🚀✨
